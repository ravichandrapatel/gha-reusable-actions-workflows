Feature to let a kube-apiserver proxy a resource request to a different peer API server.

<!--more-->

When a cluster has multiple API servers running different versions of Kubernetes, this
feature enables {{< glossary_tooltip text="resource" term_id="api-resource" >}}
requests to be served by the correct API server.

MVP is disabled by default and can be activated by enabling
the [feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) named `UnknownVersionInteroperabilityProxy` when 
the {{< glossary_tooltip text="API Server" term_id="kube-apiserver" >}} is started.
