 A [Pod Disruption Budget](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) allows an

 a certain number or percentage of {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pods" term_id="pod" >}}
 with an assigned label will not be voluntarily evicted at any point in time.

Involuntary disruptions cannot be prevented by PDBs; however they 
do count against the budget.
