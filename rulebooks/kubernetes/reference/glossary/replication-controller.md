A workload management {{< glossary_tooltip text="object" term_id="object" >}}
that manages a replicated application, ensuring that
a specific number of instances of a {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pod" term_id="pod" >}} are running.

<!--more-->

The control plane ensures that the defined number of Pods are running, even if some
Pods fail, if you delete Pods manually, or if too many are started by mistake.

ReplicationController is deprecated. See
{{< glossary_tooltip text="Deployment" term_id="deployment" >}}, which is similar.
