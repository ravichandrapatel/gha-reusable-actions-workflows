[Pod disruption](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) is the process by which 
Pods on Nodes are terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily.

unavoidable issues like Nodes running out of {{< glossary_tooltip text="resources" term_id="infrastructure-resource" >}},
or by accidental deletions.
