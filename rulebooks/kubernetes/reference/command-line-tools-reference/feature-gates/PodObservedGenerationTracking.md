Enables the kubelet to set `observedGeneration` in the Pod `.status`, and enables other components to set `observedGeneration` in pod conditions.
This feature allows reflecting the `.metadata.generation` of the Pod at the time that the overall status, or some specific condition, was being recorded.
Storing it helps avoid risks associated with _lost updates_.
