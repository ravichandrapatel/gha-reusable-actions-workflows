Enable legacy writes to update container `ready` status after the kubelet detects a
[restart](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#kubelet-restarts).

This feature gate was introduced to allow you revert the behavior to a previously used default.
If you are satisfied with the default behavior, you do not need to enable this
feature gate.
