 One or more {{< glossary_tooltip text="containers" term_id="container" >}} that are typically started before any app containers run.

Sidecar containers are like regular app containers, but with a different purpose: the sidecar provides a Pod-local service to the main app container.

Read [Sidecar containers](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/) for more information.
