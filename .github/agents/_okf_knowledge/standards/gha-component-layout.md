# GHA Component Layout

## MUST

1. Composite actions **MUST** live at `actions/{category}/{name}/`.
2. Each action directory **MUST** contain `action.yml` (or `action.yaml`) and `readme.md`.
3. Reusable workflows **MUST** live at `workflows/{category}/{name}/`.
4. Each workflow directory **MUST** contain exactly one `workflow.yml` (or `.yaml`) and `readme.md`.
5. Release Manager `component_path` **MUST** start with `actions/` or `workflows/`.
6. Categories in use today: `common`, `security` (actions); `common` (workflows).

## FORBIDDEN

1. Inventing alternate trees outside `actions/` or `workflows/` for publishable components.
2. Multiple workflow YAML files in one workflow component directory.

## Prompt Card

```text
Layout MUST:
- actions/{category}/{name}/ → action.yml|yaml + readme.md
- workflows/{category}/{name}/ → exactly one workflow.yml|yaml + readme.md
- component_path starts with actions/ or workflows/
- categories today: actions common|security; workflows common
FORBIDDEN: trees outside actions|workflows; multi workflow YAML per dir
```
